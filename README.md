# war-of-empires

Goal of this project is to create a ascii character based strategy game inspired by warcraft 3.
However major focus of the project is it's architecture and glue code to support potentially a wide range of platforms.

Currently the main target platform is webassembly. However based on the core implementation it should be easy to port this 
project to other platforms. 

In addition it is also an attempt to learn more about the rust programming language and it's cross platform capabilities. 
This project has pet project characteristics. Therefore I code on it whenever I have some time left...
